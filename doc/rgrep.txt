*rgrep.txt*   Plugin that integrates grep with Vim

INTRODUCTION                                                             *rgrep*

This assume you have set grepprg to something like this:

    set grepprg=grep\ -nrI\ --exclude-dir=target\ --exclude-dir=tmp\ --exclude-dir=log\ --exclude="*.min.js"\ --exclude="*.log"\ $*\ /dev/null


This plugin will allow you to run grep from vim, and
shows the results in a split window.

:RGrep[!] [options] [{pattern} {directory}]                               *:RGrep*

    Search for {pattern} recursively in {directory}.
    The word under cursor is searched in all files if {pattern} is omitted.
    Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but will open the |Quickfix| window
    for you. If [!] is not given the first error is jumped to.

:RGrepAdd [options] [{pattern} {directory}]                            *:RGrepAdd*

    Just like |:RGrep|, but instead of making a new list, the matches are
    appended to the current |quickfix| list.

:RGrepFromSearch [{directory}]                                  *:RGrepFromSearch*

    Just like |:RGrep| but the pattern is from previous search.

:LRGrep [options] [{pattern} {directory}]                                *:LRGrep*

    Just like |:RGrep| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are placed in
    the current |location-list|.

:LRGrepAdd [options] [{pattern} {directory}]                          *:LRGrepAdd*

    Just like |:RGrepAdd| but instead of the |quickfix| list, matches are added
    to the current |location-list|

:RGrepFile [options] [{pattern} {directory}]                          *:RGrepFile*

    Search recursively in {directory}.  Behaves just like the
    |:grep| command, but will open the |Quickfix| window for you.

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along
with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence.  <Enter> on
a line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching
line.

MAPPINGS                                                        *rgrep-mappings*

The following keyboard shortcuts are available in the quickfix window:

o                   open file (same as enter).

go                  preview file (open but maintain focus on rgrep.vim results).

t                   open in a new tab.

T                   open in new tab silently.

v                   open in vertical split.

gv                  open in vertical split silently.

q                   close the quickfix window.
